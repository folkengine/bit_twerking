Fun with Bitwise Operations

Based upon Sean Eron Anderson's [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). This is code that I'm just grabbing and playing with in order to help understand things.

-------

This project is designed to in a C++ type of environment. Since I know virtually nothing about C++ development all I can say is that I'm running it inside [Eclipse CDT](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/). Since C++ seems to be the goto language for bitwise operations, I figured I should dive right in.
